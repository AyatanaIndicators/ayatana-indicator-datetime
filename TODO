SHORT TERM TODO:
 - due dilligence in a profiler
 - need to install the .indicator file during "make install"
 - remove shared-dbus: prefs panel needs to look for running indicator in a new way
 - fix broken indicator test

LONG TERM TODO:
 - test coverage
 - lots of the service is unmockable b/c of calls to time(NULL), g_date_time_new_local(), etc
