ACTIONS
=======

 * "aboutToShow"
   Description: notifies the indicator that its menu is about to be shown.
   Workitems that are expensive on startup (such as loading EDS to query
   it for appointments, or loading GeoClue to guess our current location)
   may be deferred until this is called.
   So, calendarDay's state may not be fully populated until this is called.
   FIXME: aboutToShow should be spec'ed once for all indicators, not ad-hoc

 * "activateSettings"
   Description: opens a page for changing indicator-datetime's settings
   State: NULL
   Parameter: NULL

 * "activatePlanner"
   Description: opens up the appointment editor.
   State: NULL
   Parameter: uint64 (a time_t hinting which day/time to show in the planner,
              or 0 for the current day)

 * "calendarDay"
   Description: set which month/day should be given focus in the indicator's
                calendar and to use as a starting point when listing upcoming
                appointments in the indicator.
                Client code implementing the calendar widget should call this
                when the user clicks to a different day, month, or year.
   State: a dictionary containing these key value pairs:
          "calendarDay": string ("YYYY-MM-DD"). Used by the calendar menuitem
                         to know which year/month should be visible and which
                         day should have the cursor.
          "daysWithAppointments": an array of day-of-month ints. Used by the
                                  calendar menuitem to mark appointment days.
   Parameter: uint64 (a time_t specifying which day to give focus to)

 * "location"
   Description: Sets the user's current location. Called by location menuitems.
   State: string containing a location and a timezone
   Parameter: string containing a location and a timezone
