This documents the expections that the project has on what both submitters
and reviewers should ensure that they've done for a merge into the project.

== Submitter Responsibilities ==

 * Ensure the project compiles and the test suite executes without error
 * Ensure that non-obvious code has comments explaining it
 * If the change affects specific features, please reference the appropriate
   tags in the merge description so reviewers can test appropriately:
   [phone profile], [desktop profile], [alarms]

== Reviewer Responsibilities ==

 * Did the Jenkins build compile?  Pass?  Run unit tests successfully?
 * Are there appropriate tests to cover any new functionality?
 * Do the tag-specific tests pass?

== Phone Profile Tests ==

 * Run tests indicator-datetime/unity8*

== Desktop Profile Tests ==

 * Run tests indicator-datetime/unity7*

== Alarm Tests ==

 * Hardware wakeups for new alarms:
   1. Create and save an upcoming alarm in ubuntu-clock-app.
   2. Unplug the phone from any USB connection and put it to sleep.
   3. Confirm that the alarm sounds on time even if the phone is asleep.
      (Note: if in doubt about sleep you can see in the syslog whether the
      device actually suspended or whether the suspend was aborted)

 * Hardware wakeups for edited alarms:
   1. Edit an alarm that's already passed. (see previous test)
   2. Unplug the phone from any USB connection and put it to sleep.
   3. Confirm that the alarm sounds on time even if the phone is asleep.
      (Note: if in doubt about sleep you can see in the syslog whether the
      device actually suspended or whether the suspend was aborted.)
