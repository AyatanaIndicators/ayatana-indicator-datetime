	first, untested pass at gdbus port

2011-01-14  Ted Gould  <ted@gould.cx>

	Allowing more custom strings for formatting time and making sure they update correctly.

2010-12-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Add markup support to clock label
	
	This adds exactly the same markup support to the indicator-datetime
	label respect to the clock gnome panel applet.
	
	Now formats like the ones below can be correctly set:
	
	<span weight="Bold">%I:%M %p</span>
	<sup><span rise="3000" font_desc="ubuntu 7.5" color="#DFD8C8" weight="normal">%a %d %b</span></sup>%n<sub><span font_desc="ubuntu 7.5" color="#DFD8C8" weight="bold">%I:%M %p</span></sub>
	%a <b>%I:%M %p</b>

2010-12-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Reset the label max width when guessing it.
	
	This should reduce the indicator size when a smaller (custom) text has
	been added.

2010-12-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Set label justification to center, and connect to "screen-changed" signal
	
	Update gravity on screen change!

2010-12-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Check if the custom time format string shows seconds
	
	If it happens, update the label each second, not only every minute.
	So now you can also put any custom string showing seconds, getting
	correctly updated.
