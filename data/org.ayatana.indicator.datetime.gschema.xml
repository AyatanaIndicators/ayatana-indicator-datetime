			<summary>What the time format should be</summary>
			<description>
			  Controls the time format that is displayed in the indicator.  For almost
			  all users this should be the default for their locale.  If you think the
			  setting is wrong for your locale please join or talk to the translation
			  team for your langauge.  If you just want something different you can
			  adjust this to be either 12 or 24 time.  Or, you can use a custom format
			  string and set the custom-time-format setting.
			</description>

		<key name="show-seconds" type="b">
			<default>false</default>
			<summary>Show the number of seconds in the indicator</summary>
			<description>
			  Makes the datetime indicator show the number of seconds in the indicator.
			  It's important to note that this will cause additional battery drain as
			  the time will update 60 times as often, so it is not recommended.  Also,
			  this setting will be ignored if the time-format value is set to custom.
			</description>

		<key name="show-day" type="b">
			<default>false</default>
			<summary>Show the day of the week in the indicator</summary>
			<description>
			  Puts the day of the week on the panel along with the time and/or date
			  depending on settings.  This setting will be ignored if the time-format
			  value is set to custom.
			</description>
		</key>
		<key name="show-date" type="b">
			<default>false</default>
			<summary>Show the month and date in the indicator</summary>
			<description>
			  Puts the month and the date in the panel along with the time and/or day
			  of the week depending on settings.  This setting will be ignored if the
			  time-format value is set to custom.

		<key name="custom-time-format" type="s">

			<summary>The format string passed to strftime</summary>
			<description>
			  The format of the time and/or date that is visible on the panel when using
			  the indicator.  For most users this will be a set of predefined values as
			  determined by the configuration utility, but advanced users can change it
			  to anything strftime can accept.  Look at the man page on strftime for
			  more information.
